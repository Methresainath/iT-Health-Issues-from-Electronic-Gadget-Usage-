    <h2>Health Issues from Electronic Gadget Usage</h2>
    <p>Prolonged use of electronic gadgets can lead to various health problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eye Strain:</strong> Continuous screen exposure can cause digital eye strain due to blue light, resulting in discomfort and blurred vision. Users may experience headaches and dry eyes.</li>
        <li><strong>Back and Neck Pain:</strong> Poor posture while using laptops can lead to musculoskeletal issues. The average office worker can spend over 8 hours a day sitting, contributing to chronic pain.</li>

        <li><strong>Sleep Disturbance:</strong> Exposure to screens before bed disrupts natural sleep patterns, leading to insomnia and fatigue. Studies show that blue light emitted by screens can suppress melatonin production.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetitive Strain Injuries (RSI):</strong> Continuous typing or mouse use can lead to RSI, affecting hands, wrists, and arms.</li>
        <li><strong>Anxiety and Depression:</strong> Overuse of gadgets can lead to social isolation and mental health issues, as people may prefer digital interactions over face-to-face communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IT Solutions to Health Problems</h2>
    <h3>1. Blue Light Filters</h3>
    <p>Implementing blue light filter software can significantly reduce eye strain. Tools like <em>f.lux</em> or <em>Night Shift</em> adjust screen temperature based on the time of day.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Ergonomic Devices</h3>
    <p>Using ergonomic keyboards and chairs can prevent back and neck pain. For example, an ergonomic chair can support proper posture, alleviating pressure on the spine.</p>

    <h3>3. Regular Breaks</h3>
    <p>Encouraging the 20-20-20 rule—taking a 20-second break to look at something 20 feet away every 20 minutes—can help alleviate eye strain.</p>
    
    <h3>4. Fitness Apps</h3>
    <p>Using apps like <em>Stretchly</em> or <em>Workrave</em> reminds users to take breaks and stretch, reducing the risk of RSI.</p>

    <h3>5. Mindfulness and Mental Health Apps</h3>
    <p>Applications like <em>Headspace</em> and <em>Calm</em> can help manage anxiety and improve sleep quality through guided meditations and relaxation techniques.</p>
